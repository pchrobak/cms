cms
===

This CMS is built using cakephp and geared towards websites and companies that are product based.   Often times when handing over a website to company that is built with common open source CMS's like drupal and wordpress there is a huge learning curve.  

This is built to remove the learning curve and simplify the abilities and permissions that they need to access certain parts of their site without the confussion of a million options caused by plugin creep.
